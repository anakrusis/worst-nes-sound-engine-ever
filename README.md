The worst NES sound engine ever!
You can build it with NESASM3

Features so far:
- Supports an extremely limited range of notes (C-3 to F-4)
- Can play notes on Pulse 1 and Noise, and Pulse 2 and Tri mirror Pulse 1 (for now)
- Up to eight note durations, which ~~only somewhat~~ works
- No volume support, but there are note cuts, bin value (xxx1 1111)
- Loops when it's done
- Just one song

Features to add:
- Everything else
